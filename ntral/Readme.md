# Semantic search test with gensim and LsiModel

Small Django project with a semantic search engine via REST.

This is only for testing. Expect to find crappy code.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset

1. Download and place the specified dataset in the ntral/data folder.
2. Run notebooks/genism_semantic_search_lsi_tfidf.ipynb to create corpus, dictionary and indexes.
3. Run the server and query the search engine like done in query_example.py.

## Results:

For the query "illness" and results = 10:

It's obvious that the result shows the first and second document with the word "illness" in it, but the third document just contains related themes. Results that would never show up in a simple boolean Bag of Words model.
